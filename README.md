## EPay

Send or receive ETH using your Google/Gsuite emails

## Project Summary
Send or receive ETH using your Google/Gsuite email. User can login with their Google/Gsuite email and they will get an ether wallet created by default using torus (no requirement of metamask). They can then send ETH to another Google/Gsuite email using their email id. Whenever the receiver logs in using gmail (either first time or repeat login), then they will get to know that they received the ETH from the sender.
